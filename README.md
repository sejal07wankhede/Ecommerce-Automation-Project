# Ecommerce-Automation-Project

In order to expedite the process of looking for objects, verifying their existence, and going straight to a particular item in the event that it is located, this automation project is made to interface with a web-based application. The following tasks are automated by this project using JavaÂ and Selenium:

Search for Items: Employing a given query, this feature automatically searches for a set of items.
Check Item Presence: Ascertains whether a particular item is included in the list of search results.
Navigate to object: The script will click on the object or take other action to navigate directly to it if it is located.

Tools and Technologies: Selenium, Java, Maven
